- Marcos Laorga Sagaseta de Ilurdoz: I created the 'footer', which will be used across other pages. Additionally, I developed the 'main page', incorporating the 'header', which was created by someone else, and the 'footer' that I implemented. The search bar was implemented by Javier, while my work focused on the 'create new item' button and its associated elements. 
My five most important commits were:

  - 'footer-final': https://github.com/CodeURJC-FW-2025-26/webapp09/commit/ce5a0cb9de8c1c456cf3ffee7412ca4eb56fd62d

- Javier Méndez Hernández: I was the responsible for creating the header that had been implemented in all the pages. I helped to develope a search bar implemented in the main page. They were some mistakes made on the way, for example I had to delete the header.css and redo it all again.
  
  -  My 5 most important commits were
    -  "Implementación del header provisional": https://github.com/CodeURJC-FW-2025-26/webapp09/commit/0f25e26bb4d0ad285e6be439d86d0115169f0a0d

    - Files I contributed:
      - header.html  
      - headerBs.css  
      - README.md  
      - main_page.html    

- Ivo Hagemann Martínez: I was responsible for creating the product page “product_detail.html” with its corresponding CSS file “product_detail.css”. On this page, I had to display in detail the main entity, Product, along with its respective attributes. In addition, I included a form to create a secondary entity, adapted from work done by another teammate. Finally, I added a section to display the secondary entities (reviews). I also included the header and footer made by two of my teammates. Due to an issue that arose in recent days, many of our latest commits seemed to be lost, and I was the one in charge of fixing it. When it happened again a few days later, I fixed it once more, created an extra branch as a backup, and investigated what had happened to prevent it from occurring again.

I accidentally performed an unnecessary merge that almost cost us a lot of progress.
