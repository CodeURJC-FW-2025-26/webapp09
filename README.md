# PRACTICE 1

Marcos Laorga Sagaseta de Ilurdoz: I created the 'footer', which will be used across other pages. Additionally, I developed the 'main page', incorporating the 'header', which was created by someone else, and the 'footer' that I implemented. The search bar was implemented by Javier, while my work focused on the 'create new item' button and its associated elements. 
My five most important commits were: 'main_page_fffv', 'footer-final', 'footer' (I had to change it almost entirely), 'main_page_ffv,' and 'main_page_fv'.

Javier Méndez Hernández: I was the responsible for creating the header that had been implemented in all the pages. I helped to develope a search bar implemented in the main page. They were some mistakes made on the way, for example I had to delete the header.css and redo it all again. My 5 most important commits were "Implementación del header provisional", "Header con bootstrap implementado", "Header con desplegable para moviles", "Implementacion final del header e implementación de barra de busqueda en main_page.html" and "Eliminación del antiguo archivo css del header (header.css)".
