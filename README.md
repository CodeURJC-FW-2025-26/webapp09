# PRACTICE 1

Marcos Laorga Sagaseta de Ilurdoz: I created the footer, which will be used on the other pages. Additionally, I created the main page, adding the header, created by someone else, and the footer implemented by me. However, the search bar was implemented by someone else: I worked on the "create new item" button and the elements.
My 5 most important commits have been: main_page_fffv, footer-final, footer (I had to redo it completely in the end), main_page_ffv, and main_page_fv.
